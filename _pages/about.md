I am a second year student at the Robotics Institute in the School of Computer Science at <a style="color:DodgerBlue" href="https://www.cmu.edu/"><u>Carnegie Mellon University</u></a>. I am co-advised by Prof. <a style="color:DodgerBlue" href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/john-m-dolan/"><u>John Dolan</u></a> and <a style="color:DodgerBlue" href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-people/christoph-mertz/"><u>Christoph Mertz</u></a>. I earned my bachelor's degree from Yale University in 2017.

My research interest lies at the intersection of computer vision, machine learning, and robotics. I am working on topcis including domain adaptation, perception for autonomous vehicles, and geometry-based vision. Through my research, I want to create methods that have temporal understanding, stable interpretations of our dynamic world, and integrate over long time spans. 

I am applying for Ph.D. for Fall 2022! If you find my profile interesting, you can leave your email here: <a style="color:DodgerBlue" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc0pNwXSe3i70Q1oWu-_vAa30MI-Suf5x1ZQLZxOzysotlxWw/viewform?usp=sf_link">link</a> and I can reach out to you or feel free to reach out to me at tomb [at] cs.cmu.edu!
